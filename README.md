# HTML & SCSS TravelSite project

## The purpose of this assignment was to create a simple site based on the provided Mockup.

The main goal was to recreate a travel site that had several destination pages, and a main landing page. This was accomplished by implementing the concepts learned on unit 1 at BrainStation. I mostly focused around using proper BEM and improving on the feedback I received on CoffeeShop 1.

Concepts applied

* HTML
* Sass
* partials
* BEM
* Reusability

## ToDo

* Add responsiveness
* Add animations
